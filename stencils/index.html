                    <p>
                        Naamio was built to support Functions-as-a-Service. 
                        This allows you to deploy a brand new, fully functional, 
                        custom web application with just a few lines of code, in 
                        any language you choose: Go, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, 
                        Rust, and Swift are all supported.

                    <p>
                        Our infrastructure is managed with custom machine 
                        learning modules. Operator's powered by neural networks 
                        enable predictive artificial intelligence-inspired 
                        management of networks, storage, compilation, and security
                         to keep performance, scalability, and stability optimum.

                    <h2>Make it <strong>isomorphic.</strong></h2>
                    <p>
                        Although we fully endorse the use of standard visual 
                        libraries, such as React and Vue, our platform is designed 
                        with isomorphic best practices in-mind. Our templating 
                        engine supports both server- and browser-based rendering 
                        so you can focus on what you want to build without sacrificing 
                        performance.

                    <h3>Optimized</h3>
                    <p>
                        We leave many optimizations up to implementation, but 
                        we understand image and file optimizations can be delicate 
                        and dependent on context. So we provide a just-in-time 
                        optimization module for images and files to support faster 
                        and more efficient rendering of assets. With caching as-standard, 
                        your applications get faster the more visits you get.

                    <h3>Secure</h3>
                    <p>
                        We provide a variety of encryption methods, cross-region 
                        mirroring, and key storage. We can't see the content of 
                        your files, or databases, ever, and we don't think anyone 
                        should. The artificial intelligent operators manage the 
                        keys for you, and are designed to detect illegitimate access.

                    <p>
                        We support cross-region deployment, multiple languages, 
                        multiple currencies, and cross-provider cluster orchestration. 
                        Indeed, you can deploy to AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean (default), 
                        GCE, and IBM Bluemix easily, and if you want to deploy to your 
                        own infrastructure, you can do that just as easily.
